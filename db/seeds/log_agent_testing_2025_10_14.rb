Clear BUILD NOW recommendations (Email Digest, Custom Alerts, Trend Charts) with detailed rationale. Identified opportunity costs, strategic alignment, success metrics, and kill criteria. Output was immediately actionable with zero edits needed. Deliverable included implementation timeline, task breakdown, and decision framework for future features. This is exactly what feature prioritization should look like - would use again without hesitation."

    outcome_notes: "GOOD (4/5): Thorough security audit identifying 4 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, and 4 LOW severity issues with specific fixes. Found critical production config issues (missing relative_url_root, host authorization, callback URLs) that would have caused complete failure. Excellent categorization by severity and clear production readiness checklist. However, some recommendations were overly cautious (rack-attack for webhooks from Shopify is rarely needed) and estimated fix time (11-15 hours) felt inflated for straightforward config changes. Would have been 5/5 if more pragmatic about low-risk issues. Still extremely valuable - caught deployment blockers I would have missed."
