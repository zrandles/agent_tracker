Stripe platform risk (Smart Refunds launched). Strategic recommendation: Build attribution first, add refunds as premium feature +$29/mo. 70% code reuse between products."

No defensible moat. 8 direct competitors, all with free tiers. Low WTP ($8-20/mo). Unlikely to reach $1K MRR in Year 1. 10K+ word report with 50+ sources. Recommended alternatives: domain-specific assistants with $50-200/mo WTP."

Solid game mechanics but missing critical retention features (no accounts, no progression, no viral mechanics). 3-month roadmap: Month 1 (foundation + 500 players), Month 2 (retention + 50 DAU), Month 3 (monetization + $100 revenue). F2P + cosmetics model. Revenue projections: $500-2K/month sustainable. Web-first, PWA later, native only if proven. Immediate priority: tutorial system + daily challenges."

App 90% complete (1-2 weeks to launch). Expected $1K-5K MRR in 3 months. High CAC ($250 vs $50 Stripe). Recommendation: Launch Shopify, validate 3 months, then build Stripe Revenue Attribution in parallel. LTV:CAC 5.5:1 (healthy). Pricing: $49/$99/$199 tiers. Kill criteria: <$1K MRR by Month 3."
